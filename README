This is a minimalistic FreeBSD Ports Collection. Apart from the
original ports tree this ports tree do not contain any ports which fall
under the following category:

- Localized ports
- Ports that do not support Tier-1 ARCH
- Ports that requires special permission and are not buildable

For general information on the Ports Collection, please see the
FreeBSD Handbook ports section which is available from:

	https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/ports/
		for the latest official version
	or:
	The ports(7) manual page (man ports).

These will explain how to use ports and packages.

If you would like to search for a port, you can do so easily by
saying (in /usr/ports):

	make search name="<name>"
	or:
	make search key="<keyword>"

which will generate a list of all ports matching <name> or <keyword>.
make search also supports wildcards, such as:

	make search name="gtk*"

For information about contributing to FreeBSD ports, please see the Porter's
Handbook, available at:

	https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/porters-handbook/

NOTE:  This tree will GROW significantly in size during normal usage!
The distribution tar files can and do accumulate in /usr/ports/distfiles,
and the individual ports will also use up lots of space in their work
subdirectories unless you remember to "make clean" after you're done
building a given port.  /usr/ports/distfiles can also be periodically
cleaned without ill-effect.
